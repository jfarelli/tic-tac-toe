# Tic-Tac-Toe: Sleuth vs. Hooligan

## Will the law catch his criminal, or will crime pay?!

* Welcome to final solo project at [Turing](https://turing.edu/) within the [Front-End Program](https://frontend.turing.edu/)!

For this project, we were presented with an opportuity to build out a classic head-to-head game!

### How to play!

* Upon opening the page, you're be presented with a cleared board.
* The Sleuth starts out as he hunts for the shifty Hooligan! Feel free to click on any square to begin, and the player change will show up under the title after a move has been made!
* Upon a win, a pop-up will show declaring the winner and a point will be added to their **"Win Count"**!
* If the Sleuth catches his criminal (wins), the Hooligan will start the next game in his attemt to escape capture! If the Hooligan escapes (wins), then it will be Sleuth's turn to catch him!
* After a brief pause, the game board will reset.

* In the event of a draw, a pop-up window will display declaring **"It's a stalemate!"**
* The game will then restart after a brief pause, having the player that didn't start the turn start the new game.
